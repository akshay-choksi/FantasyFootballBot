# FantasyFootballBot
This is a Python Script for automation in login, emailing a recursive reminder, and downloading data to .xlsx. It utilizes Selenium WebDriver for the automation component as well as Pandas for web scraping. This bot has no intent of malicious activity, it is just for entertainment purposes as it is mainly to annoy my fantasy football league commissioner who can be lazy at times. It also provides the capability to download standings data. 

## Motivation 
I started this small project in anticipation of starting an internship that would require some background in the tools described above. It also expands on my interest in utilizing software for personal means.

## In-Progress
- Expanding on the data manipulating aspect utilizing Pandas

## Future
- Integrating a player analysis tool for Draft day
