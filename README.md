# FantasyFootballBot
This is a Python Script for automation in login, emailing a recursive reminder, and downloading data to a .xlsx file. It utilizes Selenium WebDriver for the automation component as well as Pandas for web scraping. This bot has no intent of malicious activity, it is mainly for entertainment purposes to annoy/remind the league commissioner. 

## Motivation 
I started this small project in anticipation of starting an internship in which I would benefit having some background in the tools described above, while also expanding on my interest in utilizing software for personal curiosities.

## Future
- Expanding on the data manipulating aspect utilizing Pandas
- Integrating a player analysis tool for Draft Day

## Credit
I used to following link to retrieve elements and launch the WebDriver:
